<noinclude>'''Missions''', also known as '''episodes''' and '''conflicts''', are a key part of [[Star Trek Timelines]], allowing players to progress in the storyline. Conflicts begin with players selecting their [[crew]]. Different crew are better suited for different tasks. Each character is proficient in at least one [[skill]]: [[Diplomacy]], [[Science]], [[Security]], [[Command]], [[Engineering]] and [[Medicine]]. Skills can be improved by levelling up, and fusing characters with extra copies of themselves. Crew also have inherent abilities called [[traits]]. For example, [[Commander Riker]] has the [[Pilot]] trait.

Once they have been selected, the [[Away Team]] is sent to resolve the conflict. In each conflict, the player is faced with choices, taking them down a different path and leading to different challenges, similar to a Choose Your Own Adventure book <ref name='SubCulutred'>http://www.sub-cultured.com/pax-east-2015-star-trek-timelines-jotun/</ref>. Players may continue with the conflict even if they fail some challenges. However, they will fail the conflict if they fail to complete the last challenge. To determine if they win a challenge or not, characters compete against that challenge's difficulty. This is where their skills and traits are used. For example, a stage may require 22 Security {{skill|sec}}. There can be different mission outcomes, for example if an [[Away Team]] utilising mostly combat oriented crew is used there may be a combat based resolution, which will be different to a diplomatic resolution, and this will affect the narrative <ref name='LoreHound2015'>http://lorehound.com/news/pax-east-2015-our-first-hands-on-with-star-trek-timelines/</ref>.

By completing conflicts, players can gain crew experience, [[credits]], equipment, knowledge and many other items. Completing conflicts is a key way to improve crew in Star Trek Timelines.
